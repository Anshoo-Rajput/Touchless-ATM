# AMOC-2021
## Inspiration
Coronavirus has affected millions of people around the globe and is rising at a very high pace. With Coronavirus being the highlight of recent times, our team realized that the major cause of widespread of this virus is contact in public places.So we developed this project to eradicate the need for contact on essential places, one of them being banks. Access to cash for many in society is remaining essential during the current lockdown around the globe. Given this, the ATM is playing an even more critical role in ensuring that consumers have access to cash and wider banking services while branches have reduced hours or closures, or customers want to avoid face-to-face or in-branch interactions completely. Studies worldwide on the virus have shown that it can remain alive up to two days on solid surfaces. Since it is not advisable to clean electronic items such as POS machines and ATMs with sanitizers after every use this project aims to ensure that bank transactions are done with minimum possible contact. Also, we further aim to expand our project to workplaces, restaurants and beyond.
